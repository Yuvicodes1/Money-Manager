Before :
Every GET portfolio request → Calls Alpha Vantage → Consumes API quota → Slows response.

If 100 users open dashboard:
= 100 × API calls
= API limit exceeded
= system fails

So, adding a simple inbuilt caching system - 
symbol → { price, timestamp }

With:
TTL (Time To Live) - Auto refresh after expiry, No repeated API calls within window
For now:
TTL = 60 seconds
